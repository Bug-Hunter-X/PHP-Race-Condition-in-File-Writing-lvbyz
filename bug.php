```php
$date = date('Y-m-d');
$file = fopen("data/data_$date.txt", "a+");
// ... some code to write to file ...
fclose($file);
```
This code snippet demonstrates a potential issue related to race conditions.  If multiple processes or threads attempt to open and write to the same file concurrently, data corruption or loss might occur because of improper file locking or atomicity.
